> **A PowerShell script that helps you update Epic Games manifest files after moving your game installations. No more manual file editing or game re-downloading needed!**

Perfect for when you've moved your Epic Games library to a new drive or folder and need to update the launcher to recognize your games in their new location.

## Quick Start

### The Problem
Moved your Epic Games folder to a new location (like a different drive)? Epic Games Launcher can't find your games anymore and wants you to re-download everything? This tool fixes that instantly!

### The Solution
1. **Prepare:** Move your Epic Games folder to its new location
2. **Download:** Get `EpicManifestUpdater.ps1` from [releases](https://github.com/wesellis/epic-manifest-updater/releases)
3. **Unblock:** Right-click the script → Properties → Check "Unblock" → OK
4. **Run:** Right-click script → "Run with PowerShell"
5. **Select:** Choose your new games folder when prompted
6. **Done:** Start Epic Games Launcher - your games are back!

## Features

- **Automatic Process** - Closes Epic Launcher and updates all manifests
- **User-Friendly GUI** - Simple folder selection dialog
- **Intelligent Detection** - Finds and updates only relevant game folders
- **Visual Feedback** - Color-coded console output shows progress
- **Lightning Fast** - Updates all games in seconds
- **Safe Operation** - Only modifies manifest files, games untouched
- **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of edge cases
- **Progress Tracking** - Shows exactly what's being updated

## System Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **OS** | Windows 10/11 |
| **PowerShell** | 5.1 or newer (pre-installed on Windows) |
| **Epic Games** | Epic Games Launcher installed |
| **Permissions** | May require administrator rights |
| **Prerequisites** | Games already moved to new location |

## Use Cases

### Drive Migration
Moving Epic Games from C: drive to D: drive for more space
```
Old: C:\Epic Games\
New: D:\Epic Games\
```

### Folder Reorganization
Organizing games into a specific folder structure
```
Old: C:\Games\Epic\
New: C:\Gaming\Epic Games\
```

### External Storage
Moving games to external drive or network storage
```
Old: C:\Epic Games\
New: E:\Games\Epic\
```

### System Reinstall
Restoring games after Windows reinstall without re-downloading
```
Backup: External drive or cloud storage
Restore: Back to local drive
```

## How It Works

### Technical Details
1. **Process Management** - Safely closes Epic Games Launcher processes
2. **Manifest Discovery** - Locates all `.item` files in the manifests directory
3. **Path Analysis** - Reads JSON manifest files and identifies old paths
4. **Intelligent Matching** - Matches game folders with new location
5. **Atomic Updates** - Updates `InstallLocation`, `ManifestLocation`, and `StagingLocation`
6. **Validation** - Verifies game folders exist before updating

### Manifest File Structure
Epic Games stores game information in JSON manifest files:
```json
{
  "InstallLocation": "C:\\Epic Games\\GameName",
  "ManifestLocation": "C:\\Epic Games\\GameName\\.egstore",
  "StagingLocation": "C:\\Epic Games\\GameName\\.egstore\\bps"
}
```

## Script Analysis

### Code Quality
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- **Input Validation** - Checks for required directories and files
- **Logging** - Detailed console output with color coding
- **Idempotent** - Safe to run multiple times
- **Performance** - Efficient file processing

### Security Features
- **No Network Access** - Works entirely offline
- **No Elevation Required** - Runs with user permissions (usually)
- **Limited Scope** - Only modifies Epic Games manifest files
- **Validation** - Verifies paths before making changes

## Advanced Usage

### Command Line Parameters
While the script uses GUI by default, you can modify it for automation:

```powershell
# Example modification for automated usage
param(
    [string]$NewPath,
    [switch]$Silent
)
```

### Batch Processing
For multiple installations or automated deployment:

```powershell
# Run for multiple users or installations
$users = @("User1", "User2", "User3")
foreach ($user in $users) {
    # Process each user's manifests
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Execution Policy"** | Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` |
| **"Access Denied"** | Run PowerShell as Administrator |
| **"Manifests Not Found"** | Ensure Epic Games Launcher is installed |
| **"Games Still Missing"** | Verify games are in the selected folder |
| **"Script Won't Run"** | Right-click script → Properties → Unblock |

### Debug Mode
Add verbose output to the script:
```powershell
# Add at the top of the script
$VerbosePreference = "Continue"
```

### Manual Verification
Check if manifests were updated:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem "C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests" -Filter "*.item" | 
    ForEach-Object { 
        $content = Get-Content $_.FullName | ConvertFrom-Json
        Write-Host "$($_.Name): $($content.InstallLocation)"
    }
```

## Testing

### Test Environment Setup
1. **Create test manifests** in a separate directory
2. **Use sample game folders** for validation
3. **Test with various path scenarios** (spaces, special characters, long paths)

### Automated Testing
```powershell
# Example test cases
Describe "EpicManifestUpdater" {
    It "Should update manifest paths correctly" {
        # Test implementation
    }
    
    It "Should handle missing game folders gracefully" {
        # Test implementation
    }
}
```
