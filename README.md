## How It Works

### Technical Details
1. **Process Management** - Safely closes Epic Games Launcher processes
2. **Manifest Discovery** - Locates all `.item` files in the manifests directory
3. **Path Analysis** - Reads JSON manifest files and identifies old paths
4. **Intelligent Matching** - Matches game folders with new location
5. **Atomic Updates** - Updates `InstallLocation`, `ManifestLocation`, and `StagingLocation`
6. **Validation** - Verifies game folders exist before updating

### Manifest File Structure
Epic Games stores game information in JSON manifest files:
```json
{
  "InstallLocation": "C:\\Epic Games\\GameName",
  "ManifestLocation": "C:\\Epic Games\\GameName\\.egstore",
  "StagingLocation": "C:\\Epic Games\\GameName\\.egstore\\bps"
}
```

## Script Analysis

### Code Quality
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- **Input Validation** - Checks for required directories and files
- **Logging** - Detailed console output with color coding
- **Idempotent** - Safe to run multiple times
- **Performance** - Efficient file processing

### Security Features
- **No Network Access** - Works entirely offline
- **No Elevation Required** - Runs with user permissions (usually)
- **Limited Scope** - Only modifies Epic Games manifest files
- **Validation** - Verifies paths before making changes

## Advanced Usage

### Command Line Parameters
While the script uses GUI by default, you can modify it for automation:

```powershell
# Example modification for automated usage
param(
    [string]$NewPath,
    [switch]$Silent
)
```

### Batch Processing
For multiple installations or automated deployment:

```powershell
# Run for multiple users or installations
$users = @("User1", "User2", "User3")
foreach ($user in $users) {
    # Process each user's manifests
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Execution Policy"** | Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` |
| **"Access Denied"** | Run PowerShell as Administrator |
| **"Manifests Not Found"** | Ensure Epic Games Launcher is installed |
| **"Games Still Missing"** | Verify games are in the selected folder |
| **"Script Won't Run"** | Right-click script â†’ Properties â†’ Unblock |

### Debug Mode
Add verbose output to the script:
```powershell
# Add at the top of the script
$VerbosePreference = "Continue"
```

### Manual Verification
Check if manifests were updated:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem "C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests" -Filter "*.item" | 
    ForEach-Object { 
        $content = Get-Content $_.FullName | ConvertFrom-Json
        Write-Host "$($_.Name): $($content.InstallLocation)"
    }
```

## Testing

### Test Environment Setup
1. **Create test manifests** in a separate directory
2. **Use sample game folders** for validation
3. **Test with various path scenarios** (spaces, special characters, long paths)

### Automated Testing
```powershell
# Example test cases
Describe "EpicManifestUpdater" {
    It "Should update manifest paths correctly" {
        # Test implementation
    }
    
    It "Should handle missing game folders gracefully" {
        # Test implementation
    }
}
```
