## Upgrade from v1.x

If you're using v1.x, simply download the new v2.0 script. No configuration changes needed. The new version is backward-compatible and adds safety features without changing how you use it.

## Safety & Reliability

**This version is production-ready:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic backups protect your manifests
- ‚úÖ Verification prevents mistakes
- ‚úÖ Logging provides complete audit trail
- ‚úÖ Error handling prevents crashes
- ‚úÖ Tested with multiple Epic Games installations

## Known Limitations

**By Design:**
- Single directory only (all games must be in same location)
- Manual restore from backup (copy files back from Backups/ folder)
- No dry run mode (but backups make this safe)

**Platform:**
- PowerShell script is Windows-only
- Python version works on Windows/Linux/Mac

These are intentional design decisions to keep the tool simple and focused.

## Troubleshooting

**Script won't run:**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

**Games not found:**
Make sure you select the parent folder containing your game folders, not an individual game folder.

**Launcher doesn't recognize games:**
Restart Epic Games Launcher completely (close from system tray).

**Want to restore backup:**
Copy files from `Backups/Backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/` back to `C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests\`
