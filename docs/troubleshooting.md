- Custom installation location
- Corrupted installation

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify Installation:**
   ```powershell
   Test-Path "C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests"
   ```

2. **Find Custom Location:**
   - Check Epic Games Launcher settings
   - Look for alternative installation paths

3. **Reinstall Epic Games Launcher:**
   - Download from [Epic Games website](https://www.epicgames.com/store/download)

### 4. Games Still Not Detected After Running Script

**Check These Items:**

1. **Verify Game Folders Exist:**
   - Check that games are actually in the new location
   - Ensure folder names match exactly

2. **Restart Epic Games Launcher:**
   - Close completely (check system tray)
   - Restart and wait for library to refresh

3. **Check Manifest Files:**
   ```powershell
   # Check if manifests were updated
   Get-ChildItem "C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests" -Filter "*.item" | 
       ForEach-Object { 
           $content = Get-Content $_.FullName | ConvertFrom-Json
           Write-Host "$($_.Name): $($content.InstallLocation)"
       }
   ```

### 5. Script Hangs or Freezes

**Potential Causes:**
- Epic Games Launcher not closing properly
- Antivirus interference
- Corrupted manifest files

**Solutions:**
1. **Manual Process Termination:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Process -Name "EpicGamesLauncher", "EpicWebHelper" | Stop-Process -Force
   ```

2. **Check Task Manager:**
   - Look for stuck Epic Games processes
   - End them manually if needed

3. **Disable Antivirus Temporarily:**
   - Some antivirus software blocks PowerShell scripts
   - Add script to exclusions or disable temporarily

### 6. "No folder selected" Message

**Cause:**
- Folder browser dialog was cancelled
- No folder was selected

**Solution:**
- Run the script again
- Make sure to select a folder in the dialog
- Choose the folder containing your game directories

### 7. Special Characters in Paths

**Issues:**
- Paths with spaces, unicode characters, or special symbols
- Non-English folder names

**Solutions:**
1. **Avoid Special Characters:**
   - Use simple folder names when possible
   - Avoid spaces, special characters, and unicode

2. **Test Path Validity:**
   ```powershell
   Test-Path "Your\Game\Path\Here"
   ```

### 8. Multiple Epic Games Installations

**Current Limitation:**
- Script only supports one Epic Games installation per system

**Workaround:**
- Run the script for each installation separately
- Modify the script to specify different manifest directories

## üîç Advanced Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

Add verbose output to the script for troubleshooting:

```powershell
# Add this line at the beginning of the script
$VerbosePreference = "Continue"
```

### Manual Manifest Inspection

Check individual manifest files:

```powershell
# View a specific manifest file
$manifestPath = "C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests\YourGame.item"
$content = Get-Content $manifestPath | ConvertFrom-Json
$content | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3
```

### Backup and Restore

Create a backup of your manifests:

```powershell
# Backup manifests
$backupPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\EpicManifestBackup"
$manifestsPath = "C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests"
Copy-Item $manifestsPath $backupPath -Recurse

# Restore from backup if needed
Copy-Item "$backupPath\*" $manifestsPath -Force
```

### Check Epic Games Launcher Logs

Epic Games Launcher logs can provide additional insights:

**Log Locations:**
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EpicGamesLauncher\Saved\Logs`
- Look for recent `.log` files

**What to Look For:**
